        Previously, during my internship at E-Learning and Earning LTD, I sharpened my skills in the MERN stack, building responsive and scalable applications with MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. I’m well-versed in modern tools like Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Firebase, Strapi, and JWT, which I leverage to create intuitive and innovative solutions. My recent projects at Eclipse Intellitech, including complex APIs and responsive frontends, reflect my commitment to pushing the boundaries of web development.
